    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare Pan: Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper. Let some overhang for easy lifting later.</li>
    <li>Wet Ingredients: In a saucepan, combine sugar, evaporated milk, butter, and marshmallow creme (if using). Heat
      over medium heat, stirring constantly, until boiling.</li>
    <li>Boil and Stir: Boil the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. This ensures everything dissolves and
      reaches the right consistency.</li>
    <li>Remove from Heat: Take the pan off the heat.</li>
    <li>Add Chocolate: Add chocolate chips (milk, semi-sweet, or a combination) and stir until melted and smooth.</li>
    <li>Flavoring (Optional): Stir in vanilla extract and any other desired flavorings (like peppermint or caramel
      extract) at this point.</li>
    <li>Pour and Set: Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared pan. Spread evenly with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Cooling: Let the fudge cool completely at room temperature, for at least 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate (Optional): You can refrigerate the fudge for a firmer texture, about 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Cutting and Serving: Once set, use the parchment paper overhang to lift the fudge out of the pan. Cut into
      squares and enjoy your creamy chocolate fudge!</li>
